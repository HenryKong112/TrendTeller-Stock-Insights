## NLP Model
- **Model**: 
   1. [SpaCy's English language model](https://spacy.io/models/en) (click to check the documentation)

      > en_core_web_sm

      - **Tokenization:** Splits text into words, punctuation, and other meaningful elements.

      - **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging:** Identifies the grammatical categories (nouns, verbs, etc.) of words.

      - **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Detects entities like people, places, organizations, dates, and other proper nouns in text.

      - **Dependency Parsing:** Analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence and identifies relationships between words.

      - **Lemmatization:** Reduces words to their base forms (e.g., "running" to "run").
      
   2. [Sentiment analysis model](https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment) (click to check the documentation)

      > nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment

      - **Sentiment Classification:** It predicts the sentiment of a given piece of text as one of five classes: 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive).

      - **Multilingual:** It can handle text in multiple languages, though it is uncased, meaning it ignores case (capitalization) during processing.

      - BERT allows the model to understand context and nuances in text, which makes it more accurate for sentiment analysis than traditional models like bag-of-words approaches.

    3. [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html) (click to check the documentation)
 
       > Gensim's LDA implementation
       
       - **Topic Modeling:** Discovers hidden thematic structures (topics) within a collection of documents.
      
       - **Input:** A collection of documents (e.g., news title, comments) represented as a bag of words or TF-IDF matrix.
      
       - **Output:** Assigns probabilities to words belonging to topics, revealing underlying topics within the text.
      
       - **Use Case:** Effective for analyzing large text datasets, such as financial articles and StockTwits comments, to uncover trends in stock market discussions.
